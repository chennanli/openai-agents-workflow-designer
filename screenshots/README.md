# Screenshots Directory

This directory is for storing screenshots of the application for documentation purposes.

## Recommended Screenshots

Consider adding the following screenshots:

1. **workflow-example.png** - An example workflow with multiple connected components
2. **code-generation.png** - The code generation modal with generated Python code

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of the application in use
2. Save them to this directory
3. Reference them in the main README.md file using relative paths:
   ```markdown
   ![app starting page, before drag/pull block](./screenshots/app_starting_page.png)
   ![after drag/drop block and connect, generate code](./screenshots/after_dragblock_codegen.png)

   ```
